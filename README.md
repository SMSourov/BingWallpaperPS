## BingWallpaperPs
Download Bing wallpaper via powershell 7.

As this is a Powershell file, Powershell has to be installed in order to run this script file.

This script file can be used in Windows and Linux. It won't have any problem and the file name will be same at both OSs.

By default, it is setup for Windows. To make it usable for your PC, you have to comment and uncomment some lines by adding "# " at the start of the line.

On Windows, the command would be "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File BingWallpaperPs.ps1".

On Linux, the command would be "pwsh BingWallpaperPs.ps1".
On Linux, it has support for GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, Budgie and MATE. I've plans for adding support for XFCE, Deepin and Unity.

This is a forked project. This was forked from [caressofsteel](https://github.com/caressofsteel/bingwallpaper). I've made my own changes to enhance the functionality of the program.

The BashFile.sh and TashScheduler.ps1 was made for the Linux OSs in mind as they don't a program like the Windows Task Scheduler. It was made to solve that issue.

It is highly recommended to use this program for personal and non-commercial use only. Keep in mind, according to Bing's website, "Use of this image is restricted to wallpaper only".
