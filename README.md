# BingWallpaperPs
Download Bing wallpaper via powershell.

As this is a Powershell file, Powershell has to be installed in order to run this script file.

This script file can be used in Windows and Linux. 

By default, it is setup for GNOME in Linux. To make it usable for your PC, you have to comment and uncomment some lines by adding "# " at the start of the line.

On Windows, the command would be "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File BingWallpaperPs.ps"

On Linux, the command would be "pwsh BingWallpaperPs.ps" or "powershell BingWallpaperPs.ps" (it depends on from where you have downloaded PowerShell)
