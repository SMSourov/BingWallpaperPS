```
$FHD_filepath = $args[0] # File path for the FHD image
$LNK = $args[1] # info whether the LNK is saved or not(T/F)
$UHD = $args[2] # info whether the UHD is saved or not(T/F)
$FHD = $args[3] # info whether the FHD is saved or not(T/F)
$FHD_info_url = $args[4] # Link to show more info about the subject
```
